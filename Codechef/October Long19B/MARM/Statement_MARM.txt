Chef is really interested in the XOR operation. He wants to take a sequence A0,A1,…,AN−1 and
for each i from 0 to K−1 inclusive (in this order, one by one), perform the following operations : 

* Let's denote a=Ai%N and b=AN−(i%N)−1 before this operation.
* Change Ai%N to a⊕b, i.e. a XOR b.

Since Chef is busy, he asked you to find the final sequence he should get after performing these operations.

*INPUT*

* The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
  The description of T test cases follows.
* The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
* The second line contains N space-separated integers A0,A1,…,AN−1.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*OUTPUT*

For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers ― the elements of the final sequence.

*CONSTRAINTS*

* 1≤T≤70
* 1≤N≤104
* 1≤K≤1012
* 1≤Ai≤107 for each valid i
